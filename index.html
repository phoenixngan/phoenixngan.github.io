      <p> My name is Phoenix Ngan. I am currently a student studying computer science at California State University, Long Beach. After switching through many different majors, my passion for technology and gaming
        brought me to computer science. Since my childhood, have always been interested in games and the way they bring groups of people together in a creative and collaborative environment. Although I have only recently
        discovered my passion for computer science, I have decided that I really enjoy learning how to code and decided to pursue a Bachelors degree for it. I am eager to learn and I am trying to grab all of the
        opportunities that I can to grow, and become a better coder. I am striving to become a great software engineer and I am enjoying every part of the journey!
