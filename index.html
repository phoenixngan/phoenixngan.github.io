      <p> Hello! I'm Phoenix. I am currently a student studying computer science at Long Beach Community College. After switching through many different majors. My passion for technology and gaming
        brought me to computer science. I have always been interested in games and the way they bring groups of people together in a creative and collaborative environment. Although I have only recently
        discovered my passion for computer science. I have decided that I really enjoy learning how to code and decided to pursue a degree for it. I am eager to learn and trying to grab all of the
        opportunities that I can to grow, and become a better coder. I am striving to become a great software engineer and enjoying every part of the journey!
